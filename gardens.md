# GaiaFest Gardens
In this document I describe the starting place - the creation of the set - for the [[100% Gaia]] performance. We start in the Gardens.

## The Gardens
The Gardens are a series of overlapping, interwoven spaces of gardens. They are imaginary spaces, though we can imagine building them. We have to build them.
