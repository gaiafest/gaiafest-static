# Gaia Jam Program
On Earth Day we gather to celebrate. We'll introduce the elements of the Climate Action Platform, and we'll get to know the different parts of the festival (and each other) a little bit better. Come hangout in the WikiBar, and find out how together we can not just make some noise, but maximise our effective and collective climate action. We start tonight at 22:00 CET. Please join using the following link: [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/6819268068)

## Endless Jam 

We are sending out a signal - a mix of spontaneously composed beats and erratic rhythms. The purpose is to alert space that its the beginnning Gaiafest's reign. Using a revolutionary cloud connected looping application we hope to ignite and collaborate with anyone who gets lost in music and Gaia.
